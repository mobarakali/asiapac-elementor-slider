# Asiapac Elementor Slider

Initially I have to create this slider plugin to solve a problem with the Elementor slider widget. The Elementor slider widget does not support Image with Content, so I created this plugin to allow users to create sliders using Images and Content.

I have a slider desing that contains an image on the left and content on the right. I first created the design in elementor and thent saved the desing as Elemento Template. After that, I created a shortcode to display the Elementor Template in the slider widget.

Thus this plugin allows users to create sliders with any custom design!

## Features

- Create sliders with any custom design using Elementor templates.
- Use Elementor templates to create sliders with images and content.
- Easy to use and customize.

## Installation

2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin panel.
3. Create an Elementor template with your desired design.
4. Use the shortcode `[asiapac_elementor_slider id="your_template_id"]` to display the slider in your posts or pages, replacing `your_template_id` with the ID of your Elementor template. Example: `[asiapac_elementor_slider ids="1371,1335"]`
5. Customize the slider settings as needed.
